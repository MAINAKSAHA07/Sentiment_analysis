This is an augmented version of FER-2013 facial emotion dataset where each image is grayscale .jpg image of dimension (48,48).

It contains total 7 emotions. They are ['Anger', 'Disgust', 'Fear', 'Happiness', 'Sadness', 'Surprise', 'Neutral'].

The original dataset had non-uniform image distribution over different classes (of emotions).

So, by random image augmentation, here I have created a uniform dataset, where the image distrubution over different classes are uniform.

Each class of Train Set has 8000 images.
Each class of Validation Set has 1000 images.
Each class of Test Set has 1000 images.
